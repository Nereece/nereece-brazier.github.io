                            I had the privilege of participating in a live brief competition led by Virgin Wines' creative director. My submission, a series of wine label designs titled 'Brazier’s Nostalgia', was shortlisted after an interview with both the Creative Director and the CEO.
<br>
<br>
This was an open brief, with the sole requirement being that the front-label illustrations convey a personal message. All wine-related information, including the name, would appear exclusively on the back label.
<br>
<br>
My collection of five label designs draws inspiration from the childhood memories of the women in my family, including myself. Each label features our year of birth and colour that, in my view, best represents our individual personalities. The fifth design collates all these memories together to highlight our shared experiences.

Growing up with curly hair myself, I became aware of a noticeable lack of representation and inclusivity in mainstream media, particularly concerning diverse hair textures.
<br>
<br>
In response, I developed a cohesive series of three poster designs centred around a vibrant, bold, and playful visual language. Each poster features hand-crafted typography and catchy, empowering slogans to convey authenticity and individuality. The result is a visually engaging campaign that champions self-expression and inclusivity.</h4>

A sustainable coffee brand known for its commitment to high-quality, health-conscious ingredients. With this in mind, I set out to redesign their packaging in a way that visually reflects their values and product integrity.
<br>
<br>
Exhale Coffee offers three distinct blends, each of which inspired a unique, hand-illustrated design that highlights the key ingredients, paired with a carefully curated colour palette to differentiate each product. I used Procreate to refine the layout and composition, ensuring each design felt both cohesive and visually distinct.
<br>
<br>
Additionally, I created custom hand-drawn typography, incorporating the signature ‘e’ from the existing logo to maintain brand recognition while adding a fresh, artistic touch. Final packaging mockups were designed using Photoshop to present a realistic and professional visualisation of the rebrand.</h4>

This particular piece was one of the few sessions where the model wore a ball gown made of delicate white and blue netting, an outfit that inspired me to experiment with a more fashion-focused approach.
<br>
                            <br>
With an interest in fashion illustration, I used this session as an opportunity to explore the form, flow, and texture of clothing through expressive mark-making. I worked with chalk on black paper to create contrast and highlight the layered quality of the gown. To refine the piece I digitally edited the background to a deep navy blue using Photoshop, creating a sense of depth and atmosphere. The finished illustration was then framed using a mockup template in Photoshop to present it in a polished, professional format.
